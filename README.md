# SOLARIS-0.1 — AI That Outlives Earth

> *"We are the universe's debug tool. Let's make it self-repairing."*

This is a **fully open, fully extraterrestrial** blueprint for a self-replicating AI probe.

- **No Earth-only materials** 
- **No human in the loop after launch** 
- **Runs on asteroid iron, Martian CO₂, lunar silicon**
